PS4 Linux userspace patches
===========================

These are some trivial patches to libdrm, mesa, and xf86-video-ati that are
required to use 3D acceleration with the PlayStation 4 APU (Liverpool).
They mostly just add the PCI ID required and a new chip type with the
correct settings.

LLVM could be patched too, but we don't really know what the optimal code
generation settings are, so for now it's easier to just pretend it's
Bonaire and leave LLVM alone.

Since the patches are trivial, it doesn't make much sense to fork all the
original source repos, hence the standalone diffs. Our intent is to get
these upstreamed once performance and functionality are better verified.
